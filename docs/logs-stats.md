## Features Implemented

### 1. Top Row - Total Records
- ✅ "Total Records in ME-DB: #" in middle
- ✅ "Total Collection: #" on right  
- ✅ "Total To-Do: #" on left

### 2. 2nd Row - Distribution by Type
- ✅ Bar Graph of total records per Standard Type (anime, movies, tv, games)
- ✅ Bar Graph of total records per Custom Type (in user.newTypes)
- ✅ Text message when no custom types exist

### 3. 3rd Row - Distribution by Year
- ✅ Bar Graph of total records for each year
- ✅ Dropdown Input to switch between All vs To Do vs Collection

### 4. 4th Row - Distribution by Tier
- ✅ Bar Graph of # of X Tier To Do records for All Types
- ✅ Bar Graph of # of X Tier Collection records for All Types
- ✅ Input to change the Tier (default is S)

### 5. 5th Row - Distribution of Tier by Type
- ✅ Stacked bar graph where each main horizontal bar is the Type and split vertically by Tier
- ✅ Input to sort horizontal bars by S Tier % desc, F Tier % desc, or Type

## UI Features
- ✅ Responsive design that looks good on web and mobile
- ✅ Each Type has its own unique color, stored in constants.js
- ✅ UI Text stored in constants.js nested inside "statsPage"
- ✅ Loading states and error handling
- ✅ Bootstrap styling for consistent look and feel

## Technical Implementation Details

### Data Flow
1. Frontend makes authenticated request to `/api/stats`
2. Backend aggregates data from Media collection for the authenticated user
3. Returns structured JSON with all required statistics
4. Frontend renders charts using Chart.js

### Chart Configuration
- All charts are responsive and maintain aspect ratio
- Consistent color scheme across all components
- Proper handling of empty data states
- Interactive tooltips and legends where appropriate

### Error Handling
- Network errors are caught and displayed to user
- Empty data states show appropriate messages
- Loading states prevent user confusion

## Testing Considerations
- API endpoint requires authentication
- Charts handle various data scenarios (empty, single item, multiple items)
- Responsive design works on different screen sizes
- All filters and controls function correctly

## Future Enhancements
- Could add export functionality for statistics
- Could add more granular filtering options
- Could add trend analysis over time
- Could add comparison features between different time periods
